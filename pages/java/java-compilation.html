        <h3 class="mb-4">COMPILATION AND EXECUTION</h3>

        <p class="mb-4">
            The Java platform includes Java programming language, Standard Java APIs, Java Development Kit (JDK), Java
            Virtual
            Machine (JVM), Java Runtime Environment (JRE). <br><br>

            <b>CODE.</b> Java is a high-level object-oriented programming language known for its simplicity and
            readability.
            <br><br>
            <b>LIBRARIES.</b> Standard Java APIs support performing common tasks such as I/O operations, networking,
            database
            connectivity, and more.
            <br><br>
            <b>COMPILATION AND DEBUG.</b> Java Development Kit (JDK) is a set of tools, libraries and documentation that
            enable
            developers to create Java applications. It includes compiler, debugger, and other utilities necessary for
            software
            development.
            <br><br>
            <b>RUN.</b> Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is a subset of JDK, containing only JVM and run-time libraries.
            Users
            need JRE
            to run Java applications on their machines.
            Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a crucial part of the Java platform. It’s responsible for executing Java byte
            code,
            which is an intermediate representation of the Java source code. The JVM interprets or compiles this byte
            code into
            machine code, allowing Java applications to run on various hardware and operating systems without
            modification.
        </p>

        <h5 class="mb-4">EXECUTION MEMORY MODEL</h5>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Run-time data areas are (1) Program Counter Register, (2) JVM Stacks, (3) Heap, (4) Method Area, (5)
            Run-Time
            Constant Pool, (6) Native Method Stacks.
            <br><br>
            <b>PROGRAM COUNTER REGISTER.</b> JVM can support many threads of execution at once. Each JVM thread has its
            own PC
            Register. At any point, each JVM thread is executing the code of a single method, namely the current method
            of that
            thread. If that method is not a native, then PC Register contains an address of the JVM instructions
            currently being
            executed. If the method being currently executed is native, the value of PC Register is undefined.
            <br><br>
            <b>JVM STACKS.</b> Each JVM thread has a private JVM Stack, created at the same time as a thread. JVM stack
            stores
            frames.
            A frame is used to store data and partial results, return values for methods, and dispatch exceptions. A new
            frame
            is created each time a method is invoked. A frame is destroyed when its method invocation completes, whether
            its
            completion is normal or abrupt (it throws an uncaught exception). Each frame has its own array of local
            variables,
            its own operand stack, and a reference to the run-time constant pool of the class of the current method.
            <br><br>
            <b>HEAP.</b> Heap is shared among all JVM threads and stores class instances and arrays. Heap storage for
            objects is
            reclaimed by Garbage Collector. Short-time objects, which quickly become unreachable, are more likely to be
            removed
            by Garbage Collector. While long-lived objects have less probability to be removed.
            <br><br>
            <b>METHOD AREA.</b> JVM loads classes from the classpath into Method Area, which is shared among all JVM
            threads.
            Method
            Areais stores class-related information and metadata. In particular, Method Area stores static variables and
            a
            run-time constant pool.
            <br><br>
            <b>RUN-TIME CONSTANT POOL.</b> A per-class or per-instance run-time representation of the “contant_pool”
            table in a
            “class”
            file. Each run-time contact pool is allocated from the JVM Method Area.
            <br><br>
            <b>NATIVE METHOD STACKS.</b> Designed to support methods written in a language other than Java.

        <h5 class="mb-4">BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY</h5>
        <p class="mb-5">
            Backward compatibility aims to ensure that changes (e.g., a new version of a programming language, a
            library, or an
            API) do not break existing software which relies on the older version. This concept implies source, binary,
            and
            behavioral compatibility.
            <br><br>
            <b>SOURCE COMPATIBILITY.</b>
            Source compatibility refers to an ability to compile Java source code written with
            older
            syntax by a newer compiler without changes in code. For instance, code written with Java 8 can be compiled
            by JDK 11
            and run with JRE 11. To specify compiler options there are “-source [source JDK version]” and “-target
            [target JDK
            version]” flags: [source JDK version] &lt;= [target JDK version].
            <br><br>
            <b>BINARY COMPATIBILITY.</b>
            Binary compatibility refers to an ability to run bytecode already compiled by older JDK
            - with a newer JRE without changes in bytecode. For
            instance, bytecode compiled with JDK 8 will be run on JRE 11. Another example where an application and its
            component (or dependency library) were compiled by JDK 8. Now, the component (or dependency library) is
            updated
            to Java 11. Due to binary compatibility, it is still possible to run on JRE 11 - previously compiled Java 8
            application’s bytecode with a new version of the component (or dependency library) compiled by Java 11. In
            the
            context of binary compatibility it’s important to mention default interface methods, which were introduced
            in
            Java 8. They allow to modify interfaces without a need to change a code which implements those interfaces
            and,
            correspondingly, no need to recompile the old code. At the same time, newly written code can use new
            interface
            functionality.
            <br><br>
            <b>BEHAVIORAL COMPATIBILITY.</b> Behavioral compatibility pertains to the consistency of the software
            behavior when transitioning between versions. It ensures that functionality remains the same, i.e., an input
            produces the same output. Other aspects of the behavioral compatibility are consistent user experience,
            integration compatibility, security, errors handling, data compatibility, performance, etc.
